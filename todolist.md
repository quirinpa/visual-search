- flann-based matcher (supposedly faster)
- norm specialization for different descriptors (save in query and train files:
	- l1, l2 for SIFT, SURF (l1 might be faster and get rid of more outliers) - add option in match
	- hamming for ORB & BRISK
- lone bucket homography tests
- better code
- man page
